# Wake Lock Feature

## Overview
Added a Wake Lock button next to the fullscreen button that prevents mobile phone screens from turning off while the app is in use. This is particularly useful for extended practice sessions.

## Features

### Wake Lock Button
- **Location**: Bottom left, next to the fullscreen button
- **Icons**: 
  - ðŸ”“ (unlocked) - Screen can sleep normally
  - ðŸ”’ (locked) - Screen will stay awake
- **Visual Feedback**: Button turns green when wake lock is active
- **Tooltip**: Shows current state and action

### Browser Support
- **Supported**: Modern mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox on mobile)
- **Detection**: Button only appears if Wake Lock API is supported
- **Graceful Degradation**: App works normally if API is not available

### Functionality

#### Activation
1. Tap the wake lock button (ðŸ”“)
2. Browser requests permission to prevent screen sleep
3. Button changes to locked state (ðŸ”’) with green background
4. Screen will remain on while the app is active

#### Deactivation
1. Tap the wake lock button again (ðŸ”’)
2. Wake lock is released
3. Button returns to unlocked state (ðŸ”“)
4. Screen sleep behavior returns to normal

#### Automatic Handling
- **Tab Switching**: Wake lock is temporarily suspended when switching tabs
- **Return to Tab**: Wake lock is automatically re-activated when returning
- **App Close**: Wake lock is properly released when closing the app
- **Battery Optimization**: System can still override for battery conservation

## Technical Implementation

### API Used
```javascript
// Request wake lock
await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen')

// Release wake lock  
await wakeLock.release()
```

### Error Handling
- Checks for API support before showing button
- Graceful fallback if permission denied
- Console logging for debugging
- Automatic cleanup on app unmount

### Event Listeners
- **Visibility Change**: Re-activates wake lock when returning to tab
- **Page Unload**: Ensures wake lock is properly released

## Use Cases

### Practice Sessions
- Long practice sessions without screen timeout
- Continuous access to sheet music display
- Uninterrupted MIDI input monitoring

### Teaching
- Extended lessons without screen interruption
- Consistent visibility during demonstrations
- Reliable display for group sessions

### Performance
- Stage use without screen dimming
- Consistent lighting during performances
- Reliable operation during live use

## Battery Considerations

### Power Usage
- Wake lock prevents screen sleep but allows other power management
- CPU can still throttle for battery conservation
- Screen brightness can still be adjusted manually

### Best Practices
- Use only when needed for extended sessions
- Remember to disable when finished
- Monitor battery level during long sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Button Not Visible
- Check if using a modern mobile browser
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Try refreshing the page

### Wake Lock Not Working
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure page is in foreground
- Try toggling the feature off and on

### Battery Drain
- Disable wake lock when not needed
- Reduce screen brightness if possible
- Consider using device charger for long sessions

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
- Automatic wake lock based on activity
- Integration with practice session timer
- Smart wake lock with MIDI activity detection
- Battery level warnings when wake lock is active
